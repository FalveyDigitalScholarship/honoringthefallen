<p>Staff Sergeant Arthur E. Bove ex ‘41, was killed on July 30th off the Ryukyus Islands while serving as a radioman and gunner on a Liberator Bomber shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. Sergeant Bove was graduated from Southeast Catholic High School in Philadelphia, where he was captain of the football team in his senior year. He came to Villanova in September of 1937 and played on the freshman football team. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in June of 1942 and was sent overseas after long training in February of 1945.

<p>According to Southeast Catholic High School, they “had no idea that at its opening it would be harboring such a student as Arthur Bove. This tall and scholarly fellow earned three letters in football and was an All-Catholic choice for Center in his Senior year. He cherishes, as the greatest events in his school life, the defeat handed to Southern and West Catholic in football.”</p>
