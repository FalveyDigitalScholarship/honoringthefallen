<h4 id="about">About</h4>

<p>Walter J. Wiegand, Corporal Gunner, 65th Engineer Heavy Motor Tank Service, England.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1918, Walter Wiegand, an old Villanova Varsity star, gave the supreme pledge of devotion to  his country. He met his death while fighting  with the 301st Battalion Heavy Tanks, an American Unit assigned to the British Forces. His division, on September 29th, started over the German lines, in advance of the Infantry. A terrible battle, which continued all the following day, was engaged in. Waltâ€™s tank was hit by a shell and it took fire. Orders were given to quit the tank. The Americans rushed out amid a fusillade of German machinegun bullets. As Walter stepped from the tank a bullet passed through his head.</p>

<p>Walter left Villanova for Camp Meade on November 23, 1917. There he was assigned to the 304th Ammunition Train. In February, he answered the call for volunteers for immediate service with the Tank Corps. With Co. A, 301st Heavy Motor Tank Corps, he sailed as a corporal on April 14th.
The lonely grave over in Bony, with the little white cross over it, must ever remain sacred to Villanova men. Walter Wiegand stood for all that was noblest in American manhood.</p>

<p>To know him was to love him for his many sterling qualities. Honest and upright, pure and clean in word and deed, a staunch defender of principle, he was at all times and in all places a power for good. Like the humble flower along the wayside, he made no pretensions to virtue, but the light of his manly character shone out among all who knew him and made them better for the meeting. He gave the pledge of devotion to country just as he did everything else, with a purity of motive and a generosity of purpose. He forgot the pain and the suffering, forgot all the sacrifices because he felt he was doing a good work for humanity -	he was doing his duty. To those who knew and loved him better than any of his friends, the dear ones of his home, the Villanovan extends first, congratulations, and then heartfelt sympathy.</p>
