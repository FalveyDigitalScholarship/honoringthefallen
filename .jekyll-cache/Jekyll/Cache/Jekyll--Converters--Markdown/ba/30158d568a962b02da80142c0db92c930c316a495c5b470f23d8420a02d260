<p>Frederick Joseph Gerngross, Jr. was born in Philadelphia Pennsylvania on November 5th, 1922. His younger brother, Joseph, was also a Villanova graduate, and also served in the Navy, on the USS Midway in World War II. He served as an Ensign in the United States Navy on the USS Indianapolis, which was sunk on July 30th, 1945 after it was struck by Japanese torpedoes. Of the 1,195 crewmen aboard the Indianapolis, only 316 survived its sinking, as the survivors were subject to shark attacks, exposure, dehydration, and saltwater poisoning. It was the single largest loss of life from one ship in the history of the United States Navy. Ensign Gerngross was declared missing in action and presumed dead. He is honored at both the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania and the Tablets of the Missing Manila American Cemetery in Manila, Philippines.</p>

<p>According to Richard Hulver, Ph.D. ‚ÄúThomas Helm, a scholar and one time crewman of USS Indianapolis (CA-35), described <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/ships/modern-ships/indianapolis.html">the loss of the ship</a> in his 1963 <em>Ordeal by Sea</em> as follows: ‚ÄúMidnight [on 30 July 1945]‚Äîa moderately heaving sea and clouds covering a half moon now nearly three hours old. The Indianapolis, with her 9,950 ton displacement spread over 610 feet, sliced her way westward into what must forever be referred to as an approximate position of 134 degrees 48 minutes East and 12 degrees 2 minutes North. The exact latitude and longitude will never be known‚Ä¶‚Äù In the seventy-two years since USS Indianapolis sank, and the fifty-three years since Helm‚Äôs dire prognosis for her discoverability, the wreckage of Indianapolis eludes detection. The Discovery Channel documented explorer Curt Newport‚Äôs unsuccessful expedition to find the wreckage of Indianapolis in 2001 and National Geographic featured another expedition to find her in the incongruously named 2005 program <em>Finding of the USS Indianapolis</em>.‚Äù</p>
