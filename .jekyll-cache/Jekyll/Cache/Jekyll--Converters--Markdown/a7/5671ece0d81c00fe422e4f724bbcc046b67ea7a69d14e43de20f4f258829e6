<p>Joseph J. Carbine was the son of James T. Carbine and Margaret Carbine.  He was born and raised in Radnor, Pennsylvania.  He withdrew from Villanova University in 1943 as a member of the Army Air Corps Reserve.  He received his commission as an officer at Freeman AAF on May 23, 1944.  He was sent to England in the same year to the 306th bomber base at Thurleigh Air Station, where he proceeded to complete multiple successful missions.  Joseph J. Carbine was killed in action on his 21st Combat Mission.  His B-17 aircraft sustained critical flak-induced engine failure after flying over Berlin.
