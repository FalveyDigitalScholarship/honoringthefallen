<h4 id="about">About</h4>

<p>Thomas J. Davis (‚ÄúTommy‚Äù to family and friends), of Downingtown, PA, was born in 1935 to Jim and Alice (Purcell) Davis. He was the youngest of three boys, one of whom, Jimmy, graduated from Villanova in 1953. Davis graduated from Villanova in 1958. During his time at Villanova, he participated in the Naval Training Corps. In the US Navy, Davis earned the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade. He was assigned to Attack Squadron Twelve (VA-12), the Flying Ubangis, based out of Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida. The squadron was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the USS Forrestal (CV-59) in September 1958. On October 8, 1958, while participating in NATO exercise ‚ÄúCrescent Hinge‚Äù about halfway between the Greek island of Crete and the coast of Libya, Davis‚Äô plane, an A4D Skyhawk, tanker BuNo. 142691, crashed into the water off the port quarter of the Forrestal, as he was attempting to land on the ship‚Äôs deck. According to the officers who reported the death, Davis‚Äô plan did not ‚Äúhook‚Äù during the attempted landing, and he did not have enough time, and was too low, to eject before his plane went down. His plane sank in 1,200 fathoms of water, and Davis was never recovered from the Mediterranean. Soon after his death, a funeral Mass, with military honors and a Navy aircraft flyover, was held for David at St. Joseph‚Äôs in Downingtown.</p>
