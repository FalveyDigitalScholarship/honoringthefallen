<p>The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Sergeant William Marshall Gaul (MCSN: 612471), United States Marine Corps Reserve, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Platoon Sergeant in Company I, Third Battalion, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea on 13 and 14 September 1951. Leading his platoon in point position during a tortuous drive by his company against a fanatically defended, enemy-held key position on commanding ground, Sergeant Gaul succeeded in gaining the base of the objective hill with his own unit intact after inflicting heavy casualties among the aggressors. Repeatedly exposing himself to intense, coordinated fire from small arms, automatic weapons, mortars and artillery, he spearheaded the assault up approximately 800 yards of steep, jagged terrain, encouraging and directing his men and inspiring them to push on despite the overwhelming odds. With his units pinned down under a stream of fire emanating from a strategically located and seemingly impregnable bunker during a bitter night encounter, Sergeant Gaul personally charged and destroyed the emplacement with hand grenades, killing two of the attackers, incapacitating six more and enabling his men to surge onward. Responding at once when an adjacent platoon was in need of supporting fires, he skillfully maneuvered one of his own light machine guns to a strategic location for delivering devastating fire to secure the position and assure the platoon’s advance. Consistently maintaining superb control to assure maximum fire power and, at the same time, provide the best possible cover and concealment for each individual, he pressed on in his unfaltering determination to overrun and destroy the aggressors and, after the objective had been seized, hastily positioned him men in a defensive perimeter and continued to direct their efforts in driving off each succeeding counterattack launched by the enemy. Mortally wounded when he moved from cover to direct his men in repulsing a counterattack and mortar barrage the following night, Sergeant Gaul, by his great personal valor, fortitude and brilliant leadership, had contributed immeasurably to the accomplishment of a vital mission with tremendous losses to the enemy, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.</p>
