<h4 id="about">About</h4>

<p>Joseph Benedict Maloney – Died off the coast of California in a training accident on Dec. 30 1941. He was a graduate of Villanova in 1937.</p>

<p>Ben and the Villanovan are synonymous. He loves Journalism. Intending to find life’s work in this particular field. Easy going and smooth, careful about personal appearance. Started as Pre-Med, ended as an Arts Man. Week ending in Nation’s Capital. Once astonished Prof. Frayne with a sea yarn. Loves horses, in fact he tumbled for one, wielding a skillful racquet. Three year member of the track squad. Activities and athletics are things taking his free time.</p>
