title: "Honoring the Fallen: An Interactive Memorial Map"
---



The [Office of Veterans and Military Service Members](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/enroll/veterans-military.html) at [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html) is collecting data and information on all veterans with a connection to Villanova. This map displays the names of these veterans, along with their branch of service, year and location of death. For those veterans reported missing in action, we have mapped the nearest location of where they were last seen. The goal of this map is to create a lasting memorial to honor the service these Villanovans made for their country. Every veteran on this map has a unique story, but there are several characteristics that tie them together. All of these veterans shared a sense of duty, selflessness, and courage. In collaboration with [Falvey Memorial Library's Digital Scholarship Program](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive/digitallibrary/digital-scholarship) and the [Distinctive Collections and Digital Engagement Department](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive), this map was made possible. This project is part of the [Voices of Villanova Veterans oral history project](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/) documenting the stories of Veterans at Villanova University.
