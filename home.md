[Voices of Villanova Veterans: Tribute to the Befallen](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/) is an oral history project, in collaboration with the [Office of Veterans and Military Service Members](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/enroll/veterans-military.html) and [Falvey Memorial Libraryâ€™s Distinctive Collections and Digital Engagement Department](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive). We hope to capture the stories of veterans with connections to Villanova, archive them, and make them available to family members, friends, and the community. This map displays the locations of where Villanova Veterans died.
