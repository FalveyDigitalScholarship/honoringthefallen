Memorialized at the Cemetery of the Holy Rood, Westbury, Nassau County, New York. He is honored at the Vietnam Veteranâ€™s Memorial in Washington D.C. where his name is inscribed at location: VVM Wall, Panel 24e, Line 30.

After graduation from Villanova in 1966, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps on 10/28/66 in Quantico Virginia, commissioning as a 2LT (Reserve) after completion of Officers Candidate School. In Vietnam on extended active duty he served as the Platoon Commander in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd MARDIV FMF.

During the month of July his battalion was conducting operations against enemy forces in the northern Quan Tri Provence to support Operations BUFFALO, HICKORY II, and KINGFISHER. 28 July, the battalion moved into Thon Cam Son and set their sights on the DMZ. On 29 July, Company E led the battalion into the DMZ, shortly after running into heavy contact with the North Vietnamese units of the 324B Division. 2LT Kisch was a casualty of the heavy fire of that day.
