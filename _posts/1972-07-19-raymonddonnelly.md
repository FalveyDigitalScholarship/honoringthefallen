Born to Raymond Joseph Donnelly and Mary Modenese Donnelly, Lieutenant Raymond Peter Donnelly (“Little Buzzy”) grew up in Waterbury, CT and attended Sacred Heart High School.  From there, he attended Villanova University and was the captain of the varsity swim team.  After graduating from VU in ‘66, he went on to receive a Masters in Biology from the University of Connecticut before entering active military service in 1968.  He served until being killed in action in 1972.

LT Donnelly died acting as a Navigator Bombardier aboard a Grumman A-6A Intruder on a bombing mission with pilot LT Michael Timothy McCormick. The Intruder sustained heavy ground fire over Phong Dinh province in North Vietnam, during which LT Donnelly was critically injured.  LT McCormick was able to pilot the aircraft back to the carrier, but LT Donnelly did not survive the mission.  Records are unclear as to whether LT Donnelly died aboard the aircraft or died aboard the USS Midway.
