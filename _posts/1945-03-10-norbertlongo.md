Sgt. Norbert R. Longo, ex '43, was killed on Iwo Jima on March 10th, according to word received by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Val D. Longo in Norristown, PA. He entered Villanova as a Commerce and Finance student in September, 1939 and withdrew in January 1940, later attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Sgt. Longo's death on Iwo Jima makes him the third Villanovan known to have made the supreme sacrifice in that historic struggle.
