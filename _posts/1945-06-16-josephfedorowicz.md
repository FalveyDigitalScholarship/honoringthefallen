Joe Federowicz attended Villanova University, where he was a member of the Football Team, Belle Air Yearbook Club, and Science Seminar Club. He graduated with a B.S. in Biology in 1937. A Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, he died on the USS Twiggs, which sunk on June 16, 1945 off of Okinawa. Commissioned on 4 November 1943, the USS Twiggs joined the Pacific Fleet in 1944 to participate in the Leyte, Luzon, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa invasions. Off Okinawa, Twiggs was struck twice by kamikazes. The second strike proved fatal. On 16 June 1945, at 2030, a single, low-flying plane dropped a torpedo, which hit Twiggs on the ship's port side, exploding in the ship's number two magazine. The plane then circled and completed its mission with a suicide crash. Enveloped in flames, the Twiggs sunk an hour later.

Joe was described as "tall and handsome and blond…presence noted on the 150’s by playing smashing, heads up ball…knows where all the books in the library are…a “V” man…modest but always pushing the class leaders in A’s and B’s…when the smart boys are stopped, Joe tells em…never waste a moment…designed for great things in the future…never worries much."
