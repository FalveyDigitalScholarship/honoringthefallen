Affectionately nicknamed, Beetle, he was described in the Belle Air Yearbook Class of 1932 as:

"Endowed with such qualities has quickly won him a foremost place in the affection of his comrades. Beetle, was moreover a student of the first rank and an athlete who did much to add to his glory of Villanova. His hearty laughter was ever a source of cheer to us who have known him since matriculation and the hall of Mendel will seem hollow without itâ€™s merry peal. In his four year stay with us, he has acquired a multitude of friends who will cherish many happy memories of him" (page 122).
