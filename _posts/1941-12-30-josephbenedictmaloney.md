#### About

Joseph Benedict Maloney – Died off the coast of California in a training accident on Dec. 30 1941. He was a graduate of Villanova in 1937.

Ben and the Villanovan are synonymous. He loves Journalism. Intending to find life’s work in this particular field. Easy going and smooth, careful about personal appearance. Started as Pre-Med, ended as an Arts Man. Week ending in Nation’s Capital. Once astonished Prof. Frayne with a sea yarn. Loves horses, in fact he tumbled for one, wielding a skillful racquet. Three year member of the track squad. Activities and athletics are things taking his free time.
