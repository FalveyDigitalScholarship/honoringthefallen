Joseph Benedict Maloney was born October 17, 1915 in Waterbury, Connecticut. He was the son of Daniel Joseph Maloney, M.D. and Ellen A. Quigley Maloney. Joseph Benedict (Ben) was the youngest of 4 children. His brothers and sister were Augustin J., Emily C., and Kenneth J. Maloney. He was the nephew of the late Cornelius Maloney, founder of the "Waterbury Democrat," and the late Arthur Quigley, former CEO of American Brass Company.

Ben attended parochial school and graduated from Crosby High School, both in Waterbury. He was a graduate of Villanova College (now Villanova University) in Villanova Pennsylvania.

While at Villanova, Ben and the "Villanovan" were synonymous. He loved Journalism. Intending to find lifeâ€™s work in this field. He was easy going, smooth, and careful about personal appearance. Ben started in Pre-Med, planning to follow in his father's footsteps. He ended as an Arts Man. Ben once astonished one of his professors, Prof. Frayne, with a sea yarn. He loved horses, in fact he tumbled for one, and wielded a skillful racquet. Ben was a three year member of the track squad. Always involved in activities and athletics, which took up his free time.

Ben was employed as a photographer and reporter for "The Waterbury Democrat," and later took a position in the city welfare department.

He was accepted as an army flying cadet in November, and graduated in July at Maxwell Field in Alabama where he received his wings, and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the US Army Air Corp. Ben was a member of the Red Raider's.

In 1941, he was the co-pilot of a Martin B-26, which disappeared on December 30th, during a training mission in California. The bomber was flying in formation with 8 other planes, and ran into icy weather and poor visibility in the mountains. The wreckage was eventually located near the crest of Keller Peak, close to the Cajon Pass, 25 miles east of San Bernardino. He died December 30, 1941 at the age of 26, and is buried in the Maloney family plot at New Saint Joseph Cemetery in Waterbury, Connecticut.
