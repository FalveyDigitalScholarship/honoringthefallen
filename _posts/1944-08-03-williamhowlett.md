From the [Villanova Alumnus, V. VII No. 1, Fall 1944 magazine](https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/vudl:182408), page 11:

"William Howlett died in August as a result of wounds suffered in the shoulder and foot during the final stages of the battle for Guam in the Pacific. Shortly after Bill was injured his mother received a letter from him stating that he was on the road to recovery. Hence the news of his death came as a great shock to his family, together with Bill's host of friends among the Villanova alumni. A veteran with the Marines in the South Pacific for the past 19 months, Bill took part in most of the campaigns in that area. In April of this year he was made Executive Officer of his company and came through the [Bougainville Campaign](https://www.usmcu.edu/Research/Marine-Corps-History-Division/Brief-Histories/Marines-in-World-War-II/The-Battle-of-Bougainville/) without losing a man.

Bill and his brother John "Buzz" Howlett '40, Chief Specialist, Navy, and at present in the South Pacific, are well known for their outstanding performances on the gridiron. Bill was a member of the varsity football team for four years, and on the varsity baseball team for three years. He was President of the Junior class, and was elected Student Council delegate in the same year. He was also a member of the Sanctuary Society for four years and the History Seminar. A Mass and Requiem was offered for the happy repose of his soul in the College Chapel, following word of his death."
