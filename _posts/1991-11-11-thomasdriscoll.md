When his AV-8B was in trouble, Thomas Driscoll steered away from the Spanish village of Villagarcia de la Torre and ejected with the plane upside down. His parachute broke away before he reached the ground. The investigation determined that a problem with the ailerons caused the crash, but offered no explanation for the parachute failure. Thomas Driscoll, 26, who graduated from Villanova University on a Navy ROTC scholarship, "never seemed intimidated by the Harrier," said his father, John Driscoll.
