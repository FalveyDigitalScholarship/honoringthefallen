A young paratrooper from Wayne, who starred on the Radnor High School basketball team during his senior year in 1966, has been killed in Vietnam. the Defense Department reported Friday. Pfc. Lawrence J. Merschel, 20, of 224 Pembroke ave., was killed Wednesday by mortar fire while on patrol duty near Hue, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John A. Merschel Sr., were informed. Pfc. Merschel's father, a Sun Oil Co. executive, said his son complained in a recent letter that although he was old enough to fight for his country he wasn't old enough to vote for its leaders.

"I can't have any say in who runs our government. I can't vote. I'd get arrested and heavily fined if I was caught drinking beer," he wrote in a recent letter.

"But here I am - somebody is always getting unfairly treated, so I'll bear the burden with a smile."

Pfc. Merschel was co-captain of the varsity basketball team during his senior year at Radnor, and made the All Main Line team. He won his school's Forster Award for outstanding spirit and sportsmanship, ability and teamwork. He attended one year at Villanova University where he did well in his studies and was in the Naval ROTC, but quit to enlist in the Army in April, 1967, and had been in Vietnam since March, 1968. Surviving with his parents are seven brothers and sisters, John A. Jr., 23; Susanne, 21; Catherine, 18; Margaret, 16; Thomas, 14; Mary Beth, 13; and James, 9.

Dear Larry:

Although you were taken from this world so young, you left a lasting impact on your family and community. Your contribution to the spirit of Radnor stayed even when you departed. While many of things have changed, the spirit of our community is as strong as ever. Larry, while you were here you led your school as the mascot and showed your commitment through your diligent participation in many sports. Your basketball and soccer skills were so incredible that they are remembered to this day. And while we thank you for your service to our school, we thank you even more for your service to this country.

When given the opportunity to get out of the draft, instead of jumping at the chance, you sacrificed your education and dropped out of school to fight with those who didn’t have the same opportunities. You showed us true bravery and commitment before even going to Vietnam. While in Vietnam, you fought to protect the freedoms that we hold so dear. Unlike many, you went into the army with no force or outside reason. You gave your life to help us show others freedom.

When you did not return, your family was torn apart. They grieved for the man that they had loved so dearly as a son and as a brother. Their love for you was so strong that this grief still plagues them to this day. Because of the pain they feel, many of your siblings couldn’t be here tonight, but they are with you in spirit. Your brother John helped us to come to know you through your letters and achievements. We have all gathered here today to thank you for your service to our country and to celebrate the life that was cut far too short. We cannot extend enough gratitude for your protecting our freedoms.

After you passed, your father wrote a poem displaying his grief that I think he would want you to hear:

Vietnam, a place in my eighth grade geography book; half way around the globe from this place I call home; torn by the strife of men in an obscure struggle for obscure goals.

My son died in this steaming jungle at a place called Phouc Yen. Half way around this place called earth a family changed. The family he left was large, the void he left was immeasurable. Time goes on and days go by, but the days have changed and so has the world I live in; full, with the love of those that are here to mourn, but always an empty closet in my heart for this most beloved boy that comes home no more.

A Friend
