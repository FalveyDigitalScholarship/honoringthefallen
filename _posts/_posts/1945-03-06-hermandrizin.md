Herman Drizin was a Marine Second Lieutenant in the Second Battalion, Company “E,” 23rd Marines of the Fourth Division, Iwo Jima. He was killed in battle at the age of 24 in action on March 6, 1945. He was part of the first wave of Marines to land on Iwo Jima in February 1945. He was the leader of an attacking platoon that penetrated deep into the Japanese defense zone east of Iwo’s Sulphur pits in the early stages of the Iwo Jima battle. Herman and his squad of 13 men advanced a quarter of a mile into enemy lines, destroying three Japanese tanks and killing a dozen soldiers.

He attended Villanova University from 1940-1943 and was a star basketball player for the Wildcats. According to his nephew, Steven Drizin, Herman was "the only Jew in Villanova's starting five when he helped lead the Wildcats to a 19-2 record, the highest winning percentage of any team in their illustrious basketball history." His 1940-41 Freshman Team was undefeated at 32-0.  He started on the 1941-1942 team as a Sophomore and it was his 1942-1943 Team that finished with the best record of 19-2.([The Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_6962_b_4859367)).
