## [Villanova Veterans: Tribute to the Fallen](https://ericayhayes.github.io/villanovaveteransmap/)

This is the repository for the mapping project: Villanova Veterans: Tribute to the Fallen. This map is part of [The Voices of Villanova Veterans](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/), an oral history project, in collaboration with the [Office of Veterans and Military Service Members](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/enroll/veterans-military.html) and [Falvey Memorial Library's Distinctive Collections and Digital Engagement Department] (https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive) and Digital Scholarship Program. This map displays the locations of where Villanova University veterans have died.

This mapping project was built with [Fl√¢neur](https://github.com/kirschbombe/flaneur), a Jekyll theme for maps and texts using Leaflet developed by Niquii O'Niell and Dawn Childress, and is based on the earlier [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework. The content for the map was curated by Michael Brown, Laura Bang, Dave Uspal, Micahel Foight, and Erica Hayes at Villanova University.
